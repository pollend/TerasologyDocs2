Welcome to the Terasology Wiki!

This is a wiki for those interested in contributing to the development of the project. It doesn't cover game content, although we'll eventually link to places that do.

Use the sidebar to arrive at the most central topics this wiki covers.

See [[What is Terasology]] for some more background information.

## Contributing

Interested in getting involved with working on the game? Check the Intro links in the sidebar :-) 
 
There is a [[Quick Start | Dev Setup]] for those already familiar with development.

We also apply for [[GSOC]] every year - [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc). So if you're a student and it is that time of the year maybe check it out!

## Architecture

These pages offer more advanced insight into how specific features of the game are architected and why.

* [Block Architecture](https://github.com/Terasology/TutorialAssetSystem/wiki/Block-Attributes) - development overview of our Block system. (pending changes needed to make the game work in an applet again)
* [[Shape Architecture]] - defining 3D meshes via definitions in JSON!
* [[Block Shapes In Blender]] - more on shapes.
* [[Entity System Architecture]] - describes the structure and usage of the entity system.
* [[Events and Systems]] - describes how new game logic can be hooked in
