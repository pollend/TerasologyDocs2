##What could it be used for in Terasology ?
The creation of a new texture for a prefab (such as those in the cooking module) can be rather frustrating as one can never find *exactly* what they're looking for. Through the use of PikoPixel, one can create a texture .PNG file containing a Pixel art Texture. Further more, it could be helpful in the creation of blockTiles through its custom canvas sizing.

###Creating an asset for Terasology in PikoPixel
Simply install the software, open it up and get started!
Its an extremely easy to use software, when starting it up you'll be asked for a canvas size and that's it! after this point just fill the pixels with your desired colour and when done, click the EXPORT button and save it as a .PNG file

###Sample Step by Step creation
Alright now let's try and make a simple block (Like a stone)

1. Select 16x16 as your canvas size
2. Select the bucket tool and add a gray colour to the layer (See image below)
