### The easy way
Just head to the Aseprite website page, purchase it for 15$ and download it through steam, or as binary from the page.
### The hard way
Aseprite costs 15$ when purchasing the precompiled version, but if you look carefully at [the FAQ](https://www.aseprite.org/faq/#if-aseprite-source-code-is-available-how-is-that-you-are-selling-it), you can find out that if you compile it yourself from the freely available source code, you can then use it for whatever you want. So, head over to [Aseprite repo](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for instructions on how to compile it! **I promise you you won't be disappointed!**
