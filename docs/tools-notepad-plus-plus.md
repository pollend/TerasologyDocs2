**Software Name:** Notepad++

**Website:** https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

**Description:** Notepad++ is a free, open-source, Windows-based source code editor designed as a Notepad replacement that supports several languages. It's written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API calls, which ensures better performance compared to Webkit-based editors such as Atom or Brackets. It also has a very clean interface that supports indentation and syntax highlighting for better and quick editing.

**Usage:** Notepad++ can be used to quickly edit source code (or an asset file) without waiting for Terasology's environment to load in an IDE.

**Tutorial:** To make a quick edit to a file, simply open it using Notepad++ (Windows context menu integration can be enabled on install) and start editing! Notepad++ supports tab-based editing for working with multiple files.

The editor should automatically detect the coding language of the file and apply syntax highlighting, indentation. If it doesn't detect the language correctly and/or at all, go to the Language menu on the menu bar and select your preferred language (e.g. Language → J → Java).

JSON-based files (`*.block`, `*.prefab`, `*.ui` etc.) can be highlighted using the "Javascript" option - to add JSON reformatting support, consider installing the [JSONViewer plugin](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nppjsonviewer/).
